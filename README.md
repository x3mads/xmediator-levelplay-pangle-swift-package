# XMediatorLevelPlayPangleAdapterCompatibility

Swift Package Manager package, published by X3M, that lets XMediator
integrations use the LevelPlay `PangleAdapter` adapter together with
the Google Mobile Ads mediation adapter for the same network.

## Why this package exists

The official LevelPlay adapter package (<https://github.com/ironsource-mobile/LevelPlay-Pangle-Adapter-Swift-Package.git>) and the Google
mediation adapter package both declare a target named `PangleAdapter`,
so SwiftPM cannot build a project that includes both. This package depends on
the official LevelPlay package and exposes it under a different product name,
`LevelPlayPangleAdapter`, renaming the conflicting module so both adapters can
coexist.

## Usage

Add this repository as a package dependency and select the
`LevelPlayPangleAdapter` product instead of LevelPlay's `PangleAdapter`.
Versions match the LevelPlay adapter versions one-to-one: version
`5.35.0` of this package uses LevelPlay adapter `5.35.0`.
